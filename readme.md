#####Release notes

* Third commit of updates for UNex game  
* This version is a small update, fixing bugs directly associated with the previous
* Fixed a small error wherein, upon respawning, the game would crash due to an attempted reset of the player's sensitivity (to their saved sensitivity).
* Fixed a small error wherein the game would crash if the player attempted to access the pause menu while respawning. Currently the ability to access the pause menu has been disabled by checking the players health first.
